New note on single page app

There's a form under the id 'notes_form',
when the save button is clicked a handler for the
submit action is called. (on browser side), it
creates a note object and pushes it to a notes array. The whole page is redrawn
and the note is sent , sendToServer().
sendToServer() sends a POST request containing the note.
